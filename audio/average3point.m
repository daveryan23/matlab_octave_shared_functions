function [retval] = average3point (vector1)

% IMPROVE: Make this function work for row vectors as well as column vectors

% Force to column, slightly extend
vector2 = [vector1(1);vector1(:);vector1(end)];

% Take a 3 point weighted average.
retval = 0.25 * vector2(1:end-2) + 0.5 * vector2(2:end-1) + 0.25 * vector2(3:end);

endfunction
